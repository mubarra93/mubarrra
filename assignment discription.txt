In this second assignment we have written three functions.I have used three different js file for eachfunction.
Logic followed in those functions are as follows

1.Write a function that takes Season number and episode number as input
and gives all the information about that particular episode as output.
Logic: index.js file contains this function.
first of all total number of episodes are counted using (data._embedded.episodes.length) and stored in len variable.
For loop is ran for len times. In each iteration season number and episode number of input is compared with each episode details using if
else loop. When match found it outputs using console.log.


2.Write a function to search episode by its name.
Logic: index1.js file contains this function.
first of all total number of episodes are counted using (data._embedded.episodes.length) and stored in len variable.
For loop is ran for len times. In each iteration episode name of input is compared with each episode details using if
else loop. When match found it outputs using console.log.

2.Write a function that can take any number of episode ids as input and
returns all the information about those episodes.
Logic: index2.js file contains this function.
first of all total number of episodes are counted using (data._embedded.episodes.length) and stored in len variable.
Rest parameter is used for taking any number of episode ids as input and input is stored in array.Then array length is counted.
For loop is ran for len times. In each iteration  each array element of input is compared with each episode details using if
else loop. When match found it outputs using console.log.
